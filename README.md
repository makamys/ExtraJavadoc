# ExtraJavadoc

A tool that lets you "inject" additional javadoc into a codebase.

## Why would anyone even need to do that

Because Minecraft.

```
Usage: java -jar ExtraJavadoc-0.0.jar SRCDIR EXTRA_JSON

Creates a copy of SRCDIR, with the javadoc of the java source files within modified according to the rules in EXTRA_JSON.
